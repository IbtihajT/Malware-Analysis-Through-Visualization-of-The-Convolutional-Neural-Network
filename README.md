### Malware-Analysis-Through-Visualization-of-The-Convolutional-Neural-Network
## Motivation
Malware is a huge threat to almost everything that is Online. They are hard to detect and require a huge amount of effort to prevent them. We propose a method that uses CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) to extract the features and behaviours of malicious android apps. Those features can then be used to train different models to get a good accuracy of classifying maleware and benign applications.

## Network Structure
The layer structure of the Convolutional Neural Network that we are using is given as follow.

## Observations
Here we use 6 Layers in the Model. All these layers are being trained on the **byte-code** images of android's apk.
* We first use a Convolution layer that gives us an output shape of (206 x 206 x 32).
* A max pooling layer giving us (103 x 103 x 32).
* For the problem of vanishing gradient, a dropout layer is used with a threshold of 0.2.
* The output is then flattened out using the using the flatten layer.
* We then have a dense layer with 128 neurons.
* The output layer has 2 neurons as this is a binary classification.
* A total of 43,455,682 perameters are available to be trained and will contribute in the classification of malignent or benign files.
