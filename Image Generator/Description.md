## Dataset
After the extraction of bytecode, the bytecode per file is converted to decimal. This generates a number between the (0 - 255). The list of decimal numbers is then reshaped in (2 x 2) array. This list is then plotted which gives us one image.
## Path Generator
A function that receives 2 perameters. Folder location(that contains the byte-code files) and the extention of the files. It returns the paths of all the the files located inside of the folder.
## Instance Calculator
A fucntion that calculates the number of instances per file. Additionaly it return the maximum number of instances per folder.
## Padder
A function that padds the images as equal sized images are required by the CNN model. So the images are padded to make them equal sized.
## Image Generator.
It takes the padded images and those images are ploted and saved to genrate the image dataset.
